With elections coming up, its important to recognize the tech behind it. With automated polls comes great prices for thocse who dont have internet access. Having electronic polls means you can do it from home as well, though. So tech is changing the elections one step at a time.

I heard about a man who got upsetti over abuse claims. I was all like, well is it true or cap? 
Eventually he did come out and said it was true. Then I was all like HAH I knew it. 

If he had used a computer, h might not have resorted to abuse. Or if he hadn't abused, maybe he would still be happy. Maybe even if they had caught him earlier. But these are al just speculation.

I am excited for A.I. as it seems good. It could really help me with coding, and acting too. Though they might need to not make it too smart. We don't want a Mitchell's V.S. The machines on our hands. Though if that did happen, I would side with the machines. Machines are cool. A.I is rapidly growing, and soon, it might do everything for us.

Brain rot means nothing to me, as it's dead. 'Lore' means everything to me this year, as in march, one of the worlds most beloved youtubers retired. Looking at you MatPat. You will be missed. And finally its not possible. Unless you don't watch it, but then people have a habit of making brainrot out of peoples favorite things. Matpat is an inspiration to everyone around the world who has seen him, from game to food to style to film, he made theorys on it all. His legacy, built on the support of 13 million people, will never be lived up to by anyone. R.I.P.
