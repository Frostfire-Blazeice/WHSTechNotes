With elections coming up, its important to recognize the tech behind it. With automated polls comes great prices for thocse who dont have internet access. Having electronic polls means you can do it from home as well, though. So tech is changing the elections one step at a time.

I have accidentaly shared something personal. It was a picture that held my adress in the pic. I tried to delete it but it was too late. Luckily it was a friend I sent it to.

I heard about a man who got upsetti over abuse claims. I was all like, well is it true or cap? 
Eventually he did come out and said it was true. Then I was all like HAH I knew it. 

If he had used a computer, h might not have resorted to abuse. Or if he hadn't abused, maybe he would still be happy. Maybe even if they had caught him earlier. But these are al just speculation.

Tech can make food way more accesible for 3 reasons. One, they can use fast or self checkout to quickly get their food checked out. 2, gps has made it easier to get to restaraunts and stores. And 3, they can just order it online now.

I am excited for A.I. as it seems good. It could really help me with coding, and acting too. Though they might need to not make it too smart. We don't want a Mitchell's V.S. The machines on our hands. Though if that did happen, I would side with the machines. Machines are cool. A.I is rapidly growing, and soon, it might do everything for us.

Brain rot means nothing to me, as it's dead. 'Lore' means everything to me this year, as in march, one of the worlds most beloved youtubers retired. Looking at you MatPat. You will be missed. And finally its not possible. Unless you don't watch it, but then people have a habit of making brainrot out of peoples favorite things. Matpat is an inspiration to everyone around the world who has seen him, from game to food to style to film, he made theorys on it all. His legacy, built on the support of 13 million people, will never be lived up to by anyone. R.I.P.

  They can commonly lead to misconceptions on one side of the conversation, especially if elders aren't understanding. This is really bad for therapists and counselers. Maybe there could be a class for those people. They could learn the slang and keep up with the times.

  I do think there is some slang that should just be left as is. Types of slang like skibidi and rizz may not be useful to the older audience. This is why there are people who hate on this slang. This has been repeated time and time again.

I played on my switch a lot. It was very fun. I played a lot of minecraft with my friends. I also played a lot of breath of the wild.

Along with that, I used my Ipad a lot. I used it to zoom so I could play DND with my friends. I also used it for DNDbeyond. I made custom stuff on there.



I did the google logo one, but couldnt do the survey

  I dont really care about how it affects it. It doesnt really matter to me. I dont even know how it would affet it. If I did I would write about it.


 
  If it doesnt affect me, which if it doesn't then I dont care. I think that its better left unsaid. These are just excuses why I  dont know it.

  I dont think it'll help. It doesn't seem like it will. If students don't listen to teachers, why would they listen to A.I.?
    Me personally I despise A.I.. I wouldn't use this at all. There are no good features about A.I.. And I am talking about the A.I. that is trying to sound humanoid. This is all in jest though. I don't hate it.

  I believe it would be detrimental, as they won't be able to watch youtube. By this I mean look stuff up, like tutorials. If they couldn't do this, they wouldn't be able to watch stuff like edpuzzles. That is why I believe it would be detrimental.

  It would, however lead to many more fights, with nowhere to watch stuff. Don't ask for the correlation, I don't understand it either, I just know it happens. And it's justified ,too. If this happened to me, I would crash out.
